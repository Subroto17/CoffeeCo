CoffeeCo. - A Front-End Coffee Shop Experience

CoffeeCo. is a personal project showcasing my front-end development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This interactive website captures the essence of a modern coffee shop, 
allowing you to explore the menu and experience features like toggling elements with JavaScript event handlers.

This project serves as a demonstration of my skills in:

Front-end development: Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and interactive website.
User interface design: Crafting a user-friendly and engaging experience.
JavaScript event handling: Implementing interactive elements using JavaScript event listeners.
